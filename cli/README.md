# GitHub Action for the Docker CLI

The GitHub Action for [Docker](https://docker.com/) wraps the Docker CLI to enable Docker commands to be run. This can be used to build, tag, push and other related tasks inside of an Action.

To log into a Docker Registry, we recommend using the [Docker Login](../login) Action.

## Usage

```
action "build" {
  uses = "actions/docker/cli@master"
  command = "build -t user/repo ."
}
```
